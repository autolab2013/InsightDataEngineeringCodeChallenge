"""This module implements a linked list based queue data structure.

A queue is a data structure to hold a collection of items in order ad which
supports operations such as the addition of an item (*enqueue*) and removal of
an item (*dequeue*) can be performed. The items are always enqueued at the rear
end of the queue and dequeued from the front end of the queue. As such, the
queue can be also viewed as a First-In-First-Out(*FIFO*) data structure. In a
FIFO data structure, the first item added to the structure is the first one to
be removed. Apart from those two operations, *peek*  operation can also be
implemented, returning the value at the front end without removing it.

The particular implementation of queue in this module is based on linked list,
as array based queue implementation is already supported in python's list. In
the linked list based implementation, the queue object need to keep track of
the front and the rear nodes where each node contains an item and a link to the
next node.

..  note:: For most practical purposes, the python's implementation as dequeue
    suffices as a queue object. Use append method instead of enqueue and
    popleft method instead of dequeue for queue operations in a list.
